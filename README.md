# Murder Game 🕵️‍♂️🔪

<br/>

**Murder Game** is a Minecraft game developed for Spigot 1.8.9, based on the popular Hypixel game Murder, with some unique twists. The core mechanic revolves around the detective having a limited number of tries to catch the murderer using a testing chamber. It's a risky move as the number of attempts is a percentage of the total number of players, requiring deduction skills and careful decision-making.

## Key Features 🎮🔍

- **Gameplay Mechanics**: Murder Game implements the core mechanics of the Hypixel game Murder, with additional features and twists to enhance the gameplay experience.

- **Player Testing**: The detective in the game has a limited number of attempts to choose a player to be tested in a chamber. This mechanic adds an exciting element of suspense and deduction to the gameplay.

- **Ints and Tracking**: Players can discover "ints" within the game, which can be used to track down the murderer. While this feature is not fully implemented in the current version of the game, the groundwork has been laid for future development.

- **ArmorStand Handler**: Murder Game utilizes an ArmorStand handler to manage the positioning of players and the test cage. Invisible armor stands with specific names are used to determine player spawn positions and the location of the test cage.

- **Role System**: The game includes a role system where players are randomly assigned roles such as murderer, detective, or simple civilian. This adds variety and excitement to each round of gameplay.
